## Understand and Apply Risk Management Concepts

### Overview of Risk Management
- **Definition**: Risk management involves identifying potential risks, evaluating them against asset value and mitigation costs, and implementing solutions to reduce risk.
- **Purpose**: To develop and sustain an organization's security infrastructure in line with its mission.
- **Initial Application**: Forms the basis of a security policy.
- **Goal**: Reduce risk to an acceptable level, which varies based on organizational factors.

### Risk Evaluation
- **Broad Scope**: Considers risks from both IT and non-IT sources, including accidents, natural disasters, financial threats, civil unrest, pandemics, physical threats, technical exploitations, and social engineering attacks.
- **Comprehensive Approach**: Ensures no significant risk is overlooked, safeguarding the company from various vulnerabilities.

### Elements of Risk Management
- **Risk Assessment/Analysis**: Examines the environment for risks, evaluates threat likelihood and impact, and assesses countermeasure costs. Results in prioritized risks.
- **Risk Response**: Involves cost/benefit analysis of countermeasures and proposing response options to senior management for decision-making and implementation.
  
### Risk Awareness
- **Concept**: Effort to increase organizational knowledge of risks.
- **Components**: Understanding asset value, identifying potential threats, and being informed about implemented risk responses.
- **Importance**: Encourages adherence to security policies and highlights consequences of security failures.

## Risk Terminology and Concepts

### Key Terms
- **Asset**: Anything used in a business process, tangible or intangible.
- **Asset Valuation**: Assigning value to an asset based on various factors including cost, importance, and nonmonetary expenses.
- **Threats**: Potential occurrences that may cause harm to an organization or assets.
- **Threat Agent/Actors**: Individuals or entities intentionally exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Threat Events**: Accidental or intentional exploitations of vulnerabilities, natural or person-made.
- **Threat Vector**: The path or means by which an attack gains access to a target.
- **Vulnerability**: Weakness or absence of a safeguard in an asset.
- **Exposure**: Susceptibility to asset loss due to a threat.

### Risk Definition and Formula

- **Risk Explained**: 
  - In information security, risk is the possibility or likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability, leading to harm. This harm could include data breaches, system failures, or financial loss. Risk is tied to vulnerabilities (weaknesses in security) that can be exploited by threats (anything causing harm).

- **Risk Formula Expanded**:
  - `Risk = Threat * Vulnerability`: 
    - This formula shows risk increases with the presence of threats and vulnerabilities. Higher threat levels combined with significant vulnerabilities lead to higher risk. For example, a known software security flaw (vulnerability) with increasing attacks (threat) heightens the risk.
  - `Risk = Probability of Harm * Severity of Harm`: 
    - This version considers the impact of threats and vulnerabilities.
    - **Probability of Harm**: Measures the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited. For example, a system frequently targeted by hackers has a higher probability of harm.
    - **Severity of Harm**: Measures the potential impact if a vulnerability is exploited, ranging from minimal inconvenience to substantial financial and reputational damage.

  Understanding these risk aspects helps prioritize security measures and effectively allocate resources to address the most probable and severe risks.

### Safeguards, Attacks, and Breaches
- **Safeguards**:
  - Definition: Actions or products that reduce risk by eliminating or lessening threats or vulnerabilities.
  - Examples: Implementing firewalls, antivirus software, regular security audits, and security awareness training.
- **Attack**:
  - Definition: An intentional attempt to exploit a vulnerability.
  - Example: A hacker exploiting a software vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Breach**:
  - Definition: A successful attack resulting in the bypassing or failure of security mechanisms.
  - Example: Unauthorized access to a database containing personal customer information.

### Risk Elements and Their Relationships
- **Risk Elements Relationships**:
  - Overview: Understanding how threats, vulnerabilities, exposure, and safeguards are interconnected in the risk management process.
  - Key Relationships:
    - Threats exploit vulnerabilities, leading to potential exposure.
    - Exposure, when vulnerabilities are present and threats are likely, creates risk.
    - Safeguards are implemented to mitigate these risks by addressing vulnerabilities and reducing the potential of threats.
- **Cyclical Nature of Risk Elements**:
  - Understanding the continuous cycle of identifying and responding to risks.
  - This cycle involves constantly evaluating assets for vulnerabilities, assessing potential threats, implementing safeguards, and then reassessing the landscape for new risks.

### Approaches to Risk Assessment
- **Threat-Based Assessment**:
  - Focuses on identifying potential threats first.
  - Then, it assesses which assets could be harmed by these threats.
  - Example: Identifying potential cyberattacks and then determining which systems are most vulnerable to these attacks.
- **Asset-Based Assessment**:
  - Begins by inventorying assets.
  - Then, it identifies which threats could potentially cause harm to these assets.
  - Example: Cataloging company data assets and then assessing which types of data breaches could affect them.

## Enhanced Quantitative Risk Analysis Overview

Quantitative risk analysis quantifies the risks in monetary terms, providing a clearer picture of potential financial losses and guiding cost-effective countermeasures. It’s crucial for decision-making in risk management.

### Key Steps in Quantitative Risk Analysis

1. **Asset Valuation (AV)**:
   - **Description**: Determining the monetary value of each asset.
   - **Example**: A server's purchase price is $5,000; its AV is set at $5,000.
   - **Purpose**: To inform the level of investment in safeguarding the asset.

2. **Threat Identification**:
   - **Activity**: Cataloging threats for each asset, resulting in asset-threat pairings.
   - **Example**: Identifying malware as a threat to the server.

3. **Exposure Factor (EF) Calculation**:
   - **Definition**: The percentage of asset value potentially lost due to a threat.
   - **Formula**: `EF = (Potential Loss from Threat / Asset Value) * 100`
   - **Example**: If malware can potentially cause a 40% loss of the server, EF = 40%.

4. **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**:
   - **Concept**: The financial loss expected from a single threat occurrence.
   - **Formula**: `SLE = AV * EF`
   - **Example**: For our server (AV = $5,000) and malware threat (EF = 40%), SLE = $2,000.

5. **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**:
   - **Meaning**: The expected frequency of a threat occurring per year.
   - **Considerations**: Historical data, industry reports.
   - **Example**: If malware attacks are expected twice a year, ARO = 2.

6. **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**:
   - **Role**: Projecting the yearly financial impact of a threat.
   - **Formula**: `ALE = SLE * ARO`
   - **Example**: With SLE = $2,000 and ARO = 2, ALE for malware threat = $4,000.

### Transitioning to Risk Response

- **Next Steps**: After assessing risks quantitatively, the focus shifts to choosing the most effective risk responses based on calculated ALEs and organizational priorities.

## Risk Responses in Risk Management

### Types of Risk Responses
- **Mitigation/Reduction**: Implementing safeguards to lessen threats/vulnerabilities. 
  - *Example*: Using firewalls to reduce network vulnerabilities.
- **Assignment/Transfer**: Shifting risk responsibility to another entity. 
  - *Example*: Purchasing insurance to transfer financial risk.
- **Deterrence**: Discouraging potential security violations.
  - *Example*: Using security cameras to deter unauthorized access.
- **Avoidance**: Choosing alternative activities with lower risk.
  - *Example*: Using cloud storage to avoid data loss risks from local hardware failure.
- **Acceptance**: Acknowledging and accepting the consequences of risks.
  - *Example*: Accepting the risk of a data breach in a low-priority system where safeguard costs are prohibitive.
- **Rejection/Ignorance**: Denying the existence of a risk or hoping it will never be realized.
  - *Note*: This approach is generally not advisable and may be considered negligence.

### Understanding Inherent, Residual, and Total Risk
- **Inherent Risk**
  - **Definition**: The natural level of risk in a process or system before applying controls.
  - **Example**: A new app's inherent cybersecurity risks due to potential code vulnerabilities.
  - **Importance**: Crucial for baseline risk understanding and strategy planning.
- **Residual Risk**
  - **Definition**: Risk level remaining after applying security controls and strategies.
  - **Example**: Remaining risk of a data breach after implementing firewalls and intrusion detection.
  - **Formula Explanation**: `Residual Risk = Total Risk - Controls Gap`. This formula helps quantify the risk that persists after mitigation efforts.
  - **Controls Gap**: The difference between the total risk and the risk mitigated by implemented controls. It represents the effectiveness of the controls in reducing risk.
- **Total Risk**
  - **Definition**: The complete spectrum of risks an organization faces before implementing any risk controls or mitigation strategies.
  - **Example**: Total risk for an IT system includes risks from cyber-attacks, data loss, system failures, and insider threats.
  - **Formula Explanation**: `Total Risk = Threats * Vulnerabilities * Asset Value`. This formula quantifies the overall risk by considering potential threats, existing vulnerabilities, and the value of the assets at risk.
  - **Significance**: Understanding total risk is vital for making informed decisions about which controls to implement and where to allocate resources for risk mitigation.

### Continuous Risk Assessment
- **Ongoing Process**: Risk management is a continuous process that requires regular reassessment to ensure that controls are still effective and that new risks are identified and managed.
- **Adapting to Changes**: As the organizational environment and threat landscape evolve, so too should the risk management strategies to maintain effective security and compliance.

> **Highlight**: These key risk concepts are fundamental in risk management. Inherent risk sets the stage for understanding initial vulnerabilities, residual risk shows the effectiveness of controls, and total risk provides a comprehensive view of the potential challenges an organization may face. Regularly assessing these risks ensures that an organization's risk management approach remains robust and relevant.


## Cost vs. Benefit of Security Controls

- **Additional Calculations in Risk Response**: In qualitative risk assessment, cost/benefit calculations are involved. These relate to the mathematical evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of safeguards.

- **Safeguard Evaluation**: For each identified risk, safeguards are evaluated in terms of their potential loss reduction and benefit potential. An inventory of potential safeguards must be made for each asset-threat pairing.

- **Cost/Benefit Evaluation**: Safeguards are evaluated based on their benefit and cost relative to the asset-threat pair. This is the cost/benefit evaluation of safeguards.

- **Reduction of ARO and EF**: Some safeguards reduce both the Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) and the Exposure Factor (EF), resulting in a smaller Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE).

- **Calculating ALE with Safeguard**: The potential ALE with the safeguard should be calculated `(ALE = AV * EF * ARO)`.

- **Annual Cost of Safeguard (ACS)**: The yearly costs for the safeguard are estimated, including purchase, implementation, operation, maintenance, etc. This is the ACS.

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Security measures should not cost more than the value of the asset they protect. ACS should not exceed ALE1 (potential annual loss).

- **Cost/Benefit Calculation**: To determine if a safeguard is financially equitable, use the formula: `(ALE pre-safeguard – ALE post-safeguard) – ACS = value of the safeguard to the company`.

- **Prioritization**: Safeguards are prioritized based on their cost/benefit results. The safeguard with the highest value is the most cost-effective option.

- **Considerations**: Legal responsibility, due care/due diligence, and other factors may also influence the decision to deploy a safeguard.

- **Sorting Values**: Once you've calculated cost/benefit for each safeguard for each asset-threat pair, sort these values. The safeguard with the highest value is often the best choice.

- **Real-World Application**: Real-world decisions consider various factors, including actual cost, compatibility, IT staff expertise, and more.

- **Responsibility**: It's the responsibility of senior management or IT staff to use available data to make the best security decision for the organization.

| Value or Benefit of a Safeguard              | (ALE1 – ALE2) – ACS                                |


## Countermeasure Selection and Implementation

- **Cost/Benefit Analysis**
  - Selecting security controls relies heavily on cost/benefit analysis.

- **Additional Factors to Consider**
  - The cost of the countermeasure should be less than the asset's value.
  - The cost should be less than the benefit.
  - It should make an attack costlier than the benefit.
  - It should address a real problem, not just be available.
  - Its benefit should not rely on secrecy.
  - It should be testable and verifiable.
  - Provide consistent protection.
  - Have few or no dependencies.
  - Require minimal human intervention.
  - Be tamperproof with privileged overrides.
  - Offer fail-safe and fail-secure options.

- **Types of Controls**
  - Security controls can be administrative, logical, or physical.
  - Implement them in a layered defense-in-depth manner.

### Applicable Types of Controls

- **Preventive Controls**
  - These controls are deployed to proactively stop or prevent unwanted or unauthorized activity from occurring. They aim to eliminate or reduce the likelihood of security incidents. Examples of preventive controls include fences, locks, authentication methods, firewalls, and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs).

- **Deterrent Controls**
  - Deterrent controls are designed to discourage individuals from violating security policies. While similar to preventive controls, they often rely on the psychological impact of deterrence. Examples include security policies, security awareness training, security badges, and security cameras.

- **Detective Controls**
  - Detective controls operate after the fact to discover or detect unwanted or unauthorized activity that has already occurred. They are essential for identifying security incidents and breaches. Examples of detective controls include security guards, motion detectors, audit trails, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and incident investigations.

- **Compensating Controls**
  - Compensating controls are deployed to provide additional options to support existing controls in enforcing security policies. They can enhance the effectiveness of primary controls or act as backup measures in case primary controls fail. An example is using backups as a compensation control to restore lost data if a primary control fails.

- **Corrective Controls**
  - Corrective controls are implemented to modify the environment and address issues after an unwanted or unauthorized activity has occurred. They aim to rectify the consequences of a security incident. Examples include system reboots, malware removal tools, and file integrity checking tools.

- **Recovery Controls**
  - Recovery controls are similar to corrective controls but typically address more significant damage resulting from security incidents. They focus on restoring resources, functions, and capabilities after a security policy violation. Examples include backup and restore plans, fault-tolerant systems, and disaster recovery plans.

- **Directive Controls**
  - Directive controls are used to direct, confine, or control the actions of individuals to ensure compliance with security policies. They provide clear guidance and instructions for maintaining security. Examples include security policy requirements, posted notifications, escape route exit signs, and security procedures.

### Security Control Assessment

- **Definition:**
  - The Security Control Assessment (SCA) is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of security mechanisms within an organization's infrastructure.

- **Example:**
  - In an SCA, the organization assesses whether its intrusion detection system effectively detects and alerts on suspicious network activity.

- **Consider Privacy:**
  - **Definition:**
    - During the SCA, it's essential to consider the privacy implications of security controls.
  - **Example:**
    - When assessing the deployment of biometric authentication as a security control, the assessment should consider how the use of biometrics may impact individuals' privacy and whether it complies with privacy regulations.

- **Verification Process:**
  - **Definition:**
    - The verification process in an SCA involves systematically testing and validating security controls to ensure their reliability and effectiveness.
  - **Example:**
    - In the verification process, the organization tests whether its firewall rules effectively block unauthorized access attempts and validates the accuracy of access control lists (ACLs) to prevent unauthorized data access.



### Monitoring and Measurement

- **Quantifiable Benefits**
  - *Definition:* Security controls should provide quantifiable benefits.
  - *Example:* For example, a firewall should be able to quantify the reduction in unauthorized access attempts it has prevented over a specific period.

- **Degrees of Improvement**
  - *Definition:* Many countermeasures offer degrees of improvement.
  - *Example:* An antivirus software may not eliminate all malware but can reduce the number of successful infections, offering a degree of improvement.

- **Continuous Improvement**
  - *Definition:* Countermeasure success requires monitoring.
  - *Example:* Regularly monitoring access logs allows organizations to identify and address security weaknesses over time.

### Risk Reporting and Documentation

- **Risk Reporting**
  - *Definition:* Must be accurate, timely, and comprehensive.
  - *Example:* An organization's quarterly risk report accurately highlights recent security incidents, their impact, and mitigation efforts.

- **Risk Register**
  - *Definition:* Tracks identified risks and risk management activities.
  - *Example:* A risk register records identified vulnerabilities, their likelihood, potential impact, and actions taken to mitigate them.

- **Risk Matrix**
  - *Definition:* A qualitative risk assessment evaluating probability and damage potential.
  - *Example:* In a risk matrix, a high probability of a security breach combined with severe damage potential is marked as a critical risk.

### Continuous Improvement

- **Risk Analysis**
  - *Definition:* Compares expected asset loss cost to safeguard cost.
  - *Example:* By conducting a risk analysis, a company determines that investing in a robust backup system is justified based on potential data loss costs.

- **Periodic Risk Assessments**
  - *Definition:* Security requires updates and changes.
  - *Example:* Performing an annual risk assessment ensures that security measures adapt to changing threats and vulnerabilities.

### Legacy Devices

- **End-of-Life (EOL)**
  - *Definition:* When a product is no longer produced.
  - *Example:* An organization realizes that its legacy server has reached EOL, and the manufacturer no longer provides updates or support.

- **End-of-Service-Life (EOSL) or End-of-Support (EOS)**
  - *Definition:* Means no updates or support.
  - *Example:* After EOSL, a software product will no longer receive security patches or bug fixes.

- **High Security Risks**
  - *Definition:* Using EOSL systems poses high security risks.
  - *Example:* Continuing to run EOSL operating systems exposes the organization to vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches.

- **Security Priority**
  - *Definition:* Moving away from EOSL systems is essential for security.
  - *Example:* The organization prioritizes migrating from EOSL systems to maintain a secure environment, despite the initial cost.
